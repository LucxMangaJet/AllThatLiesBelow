## The Bachelor

This is the bachelor project of Luca Martinelli and Lucas Bödeker.

It's has been developed collaboratively in the _second phase_ of the whole bachelor.

Since the game is not the solitary creation of one of us, we decided to create a new shared repository for this project.

The individual bachelor repositories, containing the our respective _theses_ and _proposals_ can be found here:

* [Lucas Bödeker individual repository](https://bitbucket.org/btkgamedesign/2020_ba_lucas_boedeker/)

* [Luca Martinelli individual repository](https://bitbucket.org/btkgamedesign/2020_ba_luca_martinelli/)

__This is the bitbucket repository for ALL THAT LIES BELOW that is owned by the university, the original repository is independantly on gitHub and can be found [here](https://github.com/LucxMangaJet/BAMiningPrototype) __

* [Process documentation](insert miro link here)
