  Content: "Dear John,\nI\u2019ve finally opened my eyes. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll
    ever be home and I\u2019m sick and tired of waiting. I don\u2019t know why I
    didn\u2019t see it before, but while you haven\u2019t been there, somebody else
    was. Thomas was by my side the whole time and he has given me and Jack support
    that you never have. We have decided to act on our feelings and give this a try.
    I\u2019m sorry, John. I never meant to hurt you. The house is yours when you
    come home. I hope that in time you will understand and forgive me. I wish you
    all the best.\n\nGoodbye,\nIsabel"
