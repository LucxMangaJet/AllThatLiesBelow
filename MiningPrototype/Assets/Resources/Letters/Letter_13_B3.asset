  Content: "Dear John,\nJack has been acting up and started getting into fights with
    the other boys. I really wish that you were here, so that we could talk about
    this like parents do. I think Jack just really needs a father right now. Just
    as I could really need a husband. Sometimes I fear that we can never go back
    to normal. You have been gone so long, I wonder if we will even recognize each
    other, when we meet again. But maybe those worries just stem from being so lonely.
    I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be fine!\n\nLove,\nIsabel "
