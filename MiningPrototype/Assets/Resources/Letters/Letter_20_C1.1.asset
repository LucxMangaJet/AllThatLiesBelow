  Content: "Dear John,\nYou did it! Jack will start at Oakwood next week and he is
    so happy. \nNow that our son is taken care of, I\u2019ve started thinking about
    us. And while I really want you home, I don\u2019t want things to go back to
    the way they were. All the gold is going into Jack\u2019s education and where
    will that leave us? Will we have to worry about how to pay our rent again in
    a few months? Rely on Jack in a few years to pay for us? I don\u2019t want that,
    John. Maybe if you stayed a little longer we could find enough gold to never
    worry about such things again? Wouldn\u2019t that be nice?\nThink about it...\n\nLove,\nIsabel"
