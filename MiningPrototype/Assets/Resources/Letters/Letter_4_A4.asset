  Content: "Dear John,\nMoney has run out a few days ago and Mrs. Caulfield is after
    us once again. She gave us another month to pay our rent, then we lose our home.
    I\u2019m so scared. I can\u2019t do this! What about our little boy? He can\u2019t
    grow up homeless! I\u2019d rather give him up than have him lead a life like
    that. Please don\u2019t let it happen, John. I could never forgive you that.
    We really need you to come through now. It\u2019s our last chance.\n\nYours,\nIsabel"
