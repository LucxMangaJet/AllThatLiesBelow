  Content: "Dear John,\nOur cat died today. Must have finally used up all her lives
    in one of her crazy stunts. She drove me crazy, but I\u2019ll miss her. I had
    to dig a grave in the backyard. Seriously, I have no idea how you do it. I was
    ready to throw the shovel away after five minutes. The whole thing reminded me
    that life is short. I wanted to tell you that I love you and that I wish you
    were home. But what you do is important and I can wait a little longer. \n\nYours,\nIsabel"
