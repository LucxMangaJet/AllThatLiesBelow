  Content: "Dear John,\nThe weeks have passed and you\u2019re still not home. I can\u2019t
    do this anymore. It\u2019s been so long I don\u2019t even know you anymore. How
    would we ever do this? Is there a plan for situations like this? I guess not.
    But I\u2019m at the end of my rope here.\n\nYours,\nIsabel"
