  Content: "Dear John,\nDo you even still love us? Do you love me? I had a dream
    last night that you met someone new. And I realize that it might be true. We
    have been apart for so long that I can\u2019t help but wonder. Is that why you
    haven\u2019t sent any gold? Do you not plan on coming back? Surely, you wouldn\u2019t
    leave us hanging like that, right?\n\nPlease write back soon,\nIsabel"
