  Content: "Dear John,\nIt\u2019s been months and my friends tell me I\u2019m crazy
    for still holding out hope. Maybe I am. It\u2019s getting harder to assure Jack
    that you will be back soon. There is no way that we can still pay the tuition
    and he took it hard. Maybe I should stop encouraging his fantasies of you being
    a great hero. His hopes will only get crushed one after another.\n\nYours,\nIsabel"
