  Content: "Dear John,\nI miss you but I think we\u2019ve made a good choice. Life
    has been so hard on us and it\u2019ll be good to catch a break. Hopefully one
    that lasts until the day we die.\nI rented the spare bedroom to Thomas, just
    to make things easier financially. It\u2019s a good arrangement. He pays little
    rent but repairs things around the house and he keeps me company when Jack is
    at school.\n\nWith love,\nIsabel"
