  Content: "Dear John,\nI can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019ve never held that much money
    in my hands. I found us a nice little house on the outskirts of town. Jack insisted
    on buying a new cat and I gave in. His name is Oscar, he is just a few months
    old and adorable.\nI can\u2019t wait till you see the house and meet Oscar. It
    will be any day now, right? Still can\u2019t get that in my head. I\u2019m so
    happy!\n\nI love you,\nIsabel"
