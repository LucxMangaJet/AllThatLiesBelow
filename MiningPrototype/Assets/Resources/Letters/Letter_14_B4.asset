  Content: "Dear John,\nI write to remind you, that Jack\u2019s tuition is due soon.
    He really needs this opportunity and I\u2019d hate to tell him no. He is so looking
    forward to it. He also managed to stay out of fights over the last few weeks.
    Your friend Thomas came by to repair the lock on the back door and I think he
    may have had a word with him. If that is true, I am grateful. I really ran out
    of ideas.\nPlease keep the tuition in mind and I hope I\u2019ll see you soon!\n\nLove,\nIsabel"
