  Content: "Dear John,\nThomas and I talked yesterday. He has become a really good
    friend to me and to Jack. He said it was stupid of me to still wait for your
    return and he might have a point. I can\u2019t live like this, holding on to
    the ghost of days long past. And it\u2019s unfair to Jack. If I didn\u2019t hold
    up hope, he might just find a father figure in Thomas. Maybe that would be better.
    Maybe breaking this up would be best for everyone. I honestly don\u2019t know
    anymore.\n\nYours,\nIsabel"
