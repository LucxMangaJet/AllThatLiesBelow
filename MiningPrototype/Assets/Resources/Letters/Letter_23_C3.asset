  Content: "Dear John,\nJack has been at Oakwood for a few weeks now and he loves
    it. He made friends and it seems his rebellious phase is over for now. School
    work doesn\u2019t even bother him. He really is more brilliant than all of us
    imagined.\nI can\u2019t wait until you\u2019re home and see for yourself!\n\nLove,\nIsabel"
