  Content: "Dear John,\nI know I have no right to ask this, but what the hell is
    taking you so long? I miss you so much. When I lie awake at night I can\u2019t
    help but fear that our relationship won\u2019t survive this. I looked at a photograph
    of our wedding and it took me a moment to even recognize you. It\u2019s getting
    harder and harder to conjure up your face in my head. Please just come back home
    soon!\nLove,\nIsabel"
