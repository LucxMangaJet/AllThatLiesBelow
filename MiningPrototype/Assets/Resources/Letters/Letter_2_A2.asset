  Content: "Dear John,\nLife is hard without you, but so far Jack and I have managed.
    I have budgeted what little money we have left so it\u2019ll tide us over for
    a little while longer. What happens after that I don\u2019t want to think about.
    I put all my faith in you, please, 10 Gold is all we need right now.\n\nI miss
    you and I love you,\nIsabel"
