  Content: "Dear John,\r\nLife is hard without you, but so far Jack and I have managed.\r\nI
    have budgeted what little money we have left so it\u2019ll tide us\r\nover for
    a little while longer. What happens after that I don\u2019t want to think\r\nabout.
    I put all my faith in you, that you will manage to get us out of this.\r\nI miss
    you and I love you,\r\n\nIsabel"
