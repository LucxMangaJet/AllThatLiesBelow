  Content: "Dear John,\nI found Jack crying in his room yesterday. He admitted that
    he cried because he misses you. My heart broke for him. We\u2019ve been so selfish.
    Jack needs his father. Not Thomas, who, by the way, is doing a good job at being
    a surrogate father. But it\u2019s not enough and he\u2019s not you. Just hurry,
    before everything falls apart.\n\nYours,\nIsabel"
