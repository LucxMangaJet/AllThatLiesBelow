  Content: "Dear John,\nYour gold came too late. Maybe being a gold prospector is
    not your calling, maybe you don\u2019t care about us as much as I thought. I
    don\u2019t know. Jack was heartbroken when I told him he couldn\u2019t go to
    Oakwood and I couldn\u2019t stand it. I took a loan and paid the tuition. He\u2019ll
    start in a week and he can\u2019t wait. There is some money left, but I\u2019ve
    been thinking. I don\u2019t want to live from hand to mouth ever again. If you
    stayed a little longer and brought home more gold, we wouldn\u2019t have to.
    I think we should do just that. And live a comfortable life once you are back.\nThink
    about it, John.\n\nYours,\nIsabel"
