  Content: "Dear John,\nThank you for sending the gold. I bought us a nice house
    on the outskirts of town and a new cat that Jack wanted. It feels so strange,
    living in a house that is meant for us while you\u2019re not here. What if we
    won\u2019t even need it anymore to grow old? Together I mean. I guess we\u2019ll
    find out once you\u2019re home. It makes me nervous, now that it\u2019s going
    to be so soon. Are you nervous, too?\n\nYours,\nIsabel"
