  Content: "Dear John,\nLife is so much easier now that we don\u2019t have to worry
    about food and housing anymore. I didn\u2019t realize how much it weighed on
    me, but now I feel like I can finally breathe again. I\u2019m glad you agreed
    to look for gold for a little while longer. This separation is hard on our relationship,
    but it\u2019s for our son, so we will have to endure. I\u2019m glad we can invest
    in something that will make his life so much easier in the future.\n\nWith love,\nIsabel"
