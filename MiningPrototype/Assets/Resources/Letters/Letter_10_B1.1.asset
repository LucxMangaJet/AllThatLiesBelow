  Content: "My dear John,\nI can\u2019t believe you actually did it! I shouldn\u2019t
    have doubted you, I know. You would do anything for us. It\u2019s why we love
    you!\nIt\u2019s also why I come to you with another request: Jack is doing exceptionally
    well in school, and his teacher thinks he\u2019d do even better at Oakwood. It
    would be a great opportunity for him, but we\u2019ll need more gold to pay the
    tuition. I implore you to think about it, for Jack\u2019s sake. We can take a
    little more separation for the future of our son, right?\n \nWith love,\nIsabel"
