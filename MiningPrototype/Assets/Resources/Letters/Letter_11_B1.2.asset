  Content: "Hello John,\nThe gold came too late. Your old friend Thomas heard of
    our peril and paid our rent. I am mortified, but he saved us and I paid him back.\nI
    wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to write you again, but I have news from Jack. His
    teacher said he was doing well in school and that he should go to Oakwood. I
    agree. He is a bright kid and I don\u2019t want him to end up like us. If you
    send more gold, we can pay the tuition.\n\nYours,\nIsabel"
