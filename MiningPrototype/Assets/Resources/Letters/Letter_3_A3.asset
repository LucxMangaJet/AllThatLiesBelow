  Content: "Dear John,\nJack managed to break a window while playing ball in the
    garden and there goes my budgeting. He swears it was an accident and he is so
    contrite that I believe him, but I still grounded him. I know he can\u2019t understand
    the gravity of our situation, even though he is a bright kid, but I was so angry.
    Right now I don\u2019t even know if we\u2019ll have anything to eat in three
    week\u2019s time.\nPlease, John, you have to hurry!\n\nLove,\nIsabel"
